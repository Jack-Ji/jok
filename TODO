--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] graphics (3d): triangle flat shading support
[x] graphics (2d/3d): unify 2d/3d rendering process
[~] graphics (2d/3d): refactor render api to 3 steps: 1.create batch; 2.push draw data(possibly from another batch); 3.submit batch(repeatable).
[ ] graphics (3d): parallize j3d.TriangleRender's job
[~] graphics (2d/3d): postprocessing
[ ] j3d.Scene: able to order objects by distance to viewer, and render them accordingly
[ ] graphics (3d): able to merge textures of different meshes and sprites(reduce draw call)
[ ] j3d.Mesh: wavefont .obj support
[x] j3d.Camera: add visibility testing method
[ ] algorithm: ear-cutting triangulation
[ ] algorithm: A* pathfinding
